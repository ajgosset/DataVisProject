Our project has changed from the proposal previously submitted.
The new project is about visualizing the popluarity of Python in relation to other languages.
We are creating a network graph showing how often languages are tagged in stack overflow over time in python questions on stack overflow, with the size of the circle being the popularity of the languages over time. The length of the nodes equates to the number of tags, with more connections equating to a smaller length. The intent is to show how programming languages changed in popularity over time and their relation to python. The project will also include a pie chart of the popularity of the languages and a bar chart showing the same data. The data will be able to be animated from 2008 to 2021.
